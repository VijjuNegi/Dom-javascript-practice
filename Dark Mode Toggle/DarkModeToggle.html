    <p>Historically, surnames evolved as a way to sort people into groups - by occupation, place of
        origin, clan affiliation, patronage, parentage, adoption, and even physical characteristics (like red hair).
        Many of the modern surnames in the dictionary can be traced back to Britain and Ireland.</p>
